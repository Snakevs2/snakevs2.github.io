        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> is one of the top stealth action games, that I first played on the PlayStation. The Main Character is Solid Snake, a member of a special forces elite group called FoundHound. Solid Snake himself is a legend on the battlefield but he is one of many clones from the Legendary Soldier known as Big Boss.<br>I have played ever single Metal Gear Solid Game and have completed each game multiple times, with Metal Gear Solid 4 I have beaten the game about 12 times lol.Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain had a lot of players who are fans of the series worried about the new game as the Konami made a lot of changes. One of the changes that worried players was the main character was always voiced by David Hayter. But with the new game, they changed the voice actor to Kiefer Sutherland, and made the new game an open world game.

        <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_3:_Wild_Hunt">Witcher 3</a> was one of my top favorite games, the story line alone made the game one of the top games of the year and won awards and is one of the largest open world games. Witcher 3 is about a monster hunter named Geralt on a quest to find a young girl named Ciri that he raised and took in as a daughter. Geralt finds along aside with various allies, as he searches for Ciri and helps save the world from an evil group called the Wild Hunt. Witcher 3 is known for how well the game was put together but a small gaming company with a low budget, one of the most rememberable features of Witcher 3 is the music.<br>

        <img src="http://howlongtobeat.com/gameimages/26831_Hitman.jpg"><br>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitman_(series)#Hitman_Trilogy">Hitman</a> is another top stealth action game, one of the best aspects of Hitman is that you are able to choose how to take out your target. You can either go completely silence or an all out gun battle trying to stay alive. With the new Hitman, the first mission you have two targets and there are about 300 different NPCs and you are able to only kill the two targets in various ways or just shoot everyone in the fist mission. One of my favorite ways to get to the targets quietly is to put poison in their drinks and once they are alone in the bathroom, drown them in their own vomit. One of the best moments in the newest Hitman game is the developers made Gary Busey as a target and they were able to get Gary Busey to voice act for the part, and the dialogue is just amazing. <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RmnxrUXwKxw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <img src="http://cdn3.dualshockers.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gta-v-main.jpg" style="width:700px; height:400px;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V"><br>Grand Theft Auto V</a> is an mass open-world game that you can steal cars run over people and run from the cops. In GTA V you play between three main characters Michael, Trevor and Franklin. GTA has been around for a long time and each game get better and bigger with more and more violence, GTA V takes all that and doubles it. You can go around with a tank and cause a massive mayhem, well stealing very car you see. With GTA V there is a new mode called Grand Theft Auto Online, where you are able to make your online character and go on jobs to rob banks, take out other players and rob stores. I have easily put over a hundred hours into GTA V and hope the next GTA title will be just as awesome if not better.<br>

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham">Batman Arkham</a> series by the developers of Rocksteady Studios is one of the best Batman series ever made. I loved each one of their Batman games: Batman: Arkham Asylum 2009), Batman: Arkham City (2011) and Batman: Arkham Knight (2015). Each storyline is very well done and has depth to each game and is true to the comics. Rocksteady Studios brought on the voice actors from Batman: The Animated Series, Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy as The Joker and Batman. Both voice actors have been voice Batman and Joker since 1994, for various animated series tv shows and animated movies and video games.<br>

        Below I have added a table, here I have added stats on why I feel these games are my top favorite games. For Metal Gear Solid Series I will use Metal Gear Solid 4, which might have been my favorite of the Metal Gear Solid Series, and Batman Arkham Knight for the Batman Series. Hitman 2016 is an episodic game that was released this year and still getting new Story missions. The stats will cover the following key points:</p>
        <ul>
                <li style="font-size: 20px">Storyline: How in-depth in detail the story was and how I was able to connect with the characters and not just wanting the cutscenes to end. If the state shows 10+ means I was so immersed into the story that I had post-game depression.</li>
                <li style="font-size: 20px">Length: How long it took to beat the Storyline or complete the game 100% including side-missions if any side-missions.</li>
                <li style="font-size: 20px">Environment: How details the world is and character and how small pieces of clothing, armor, hair, grass or tree move. I like to be able to see cutscenes with the characters facial hair or the face changes depending on their expressions.</li>
                <li style="font-size: 20px">Combat System: How complex the combat system is and how difficult to learn how to fight new moves or the use of magic or items in-game.</li>
                <li style="font-size: 20px">Soundtrack: I love it when games have great soundtracks and tones that change depending on the situation or area. With me, I feel it increases the experience of enjoying the story or combat or just traveling from one place to another.</li>
            </ul> 
            <p style="font-size: 20px">Some of the table states will be marked from 1-10, 1 being the lowest and 10 being the best.</p>
