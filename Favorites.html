        <p>One of my favorite thing to eat is a Philly CheeseSteak from a local sandwich shop called <a href="http://www.hoodyssubs.com/">Hoody's.</a> They make some of the best Philly CheeseSteak in town, and have some really great prices. They have been around since 1989, I have been going to Hoody's since High school.

        One of my favorite movie theaters to go to is <a href="https://www.flixbrewhouse.com/round-rock">Flix Brewhouse</a> in Round Rock. They have a great selection of beer and they even brew their own beer, while seeing any movie you are able to order food and drinks that their servers will bring to you before and during the movie. They have been open in Round Rock for a few years now, I went to them on their opening day and I love their seats they fix this fat man very well lol. In the last year I have seen about 10 movies in theaters and seen 7 of them at Flix, the reset has been at other theaters. One thing that I really like about them is with certain movies they will change up their menu to have funny names that fit the movie.</p>
